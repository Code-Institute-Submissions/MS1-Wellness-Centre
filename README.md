## Overview.
During these uncertain community hubs are needed more than ever with most still waiting to be reopened due to the COVID19 outbreak.  
With health services only able to see a select number of patients per day and social hubs remaining closed the populations physical 
and mental health is being put at risk.

A wellness centre aims to provide positive mental and physical hygiene to the community by not only providing a gym with fitness 
classes but also by having experienced practitioners on site to help with the other needs such as physiotherapy, acupuncture, reflexology 
etc.  The aim of Central Wellness is to provide a family style experience to the users with a pay as you go or membership plan. 
Attracting and maintaining members and users is vital to the company and the website will provide the information the users are looking for 
such class timetables and gym schedules, contact details, pictures showcasing the centre etc.
