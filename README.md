### **Overview**
During these uncertain community hubs are needed more than ever with most still waiting to be reopened due to the COVID19 outbreak.  
With health services only able to see a select number of patients per day and social hubs remaining closed the populations physical 
and mental health is being put at risk.

A wellness centre aims to promote positive mental and physical wellbeing to the community by not only providing a gym with fitness 
classes but also by having experienced practitioners on site to help with other needs such as physiotherapy, acupuncture and
reflexology.
